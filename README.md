# AberratioReader
Portable XAML Reader. 

I know you need it, I know you want it. XAML!

```csharp
foreach (thing in life) 
{
   world.Shout(string.Format("XAML is the best language to describe {0}", thing);
}
```

For the moment, there is only a Markup Extension parser.

Thanks to [Nicholas Blumhardt](https://twitter.com/nblumhardt) for his awesome project [Sprache](https://github.com/sprache/Sprache) that has instroduced me in the world of parsers.
